# Big-Data-Analytics

The purpose of the project was to familiarize us with the basic steps of the process followed
for applying data mining techniques, namely: collection, preprocessing / cleaning,
conversion, application of data mining techniques and evaluation. Implementation was
done in the Python programming language using the SciKit Learn and Keras tool. The thesis
consists of two (2) tasks related to categorization, duplication detection. 

Two (2) separate
competitions have been created for the requirements of the job on the Kaggle platform.
